CATEGORIZE_EMAILS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """### Goal
You will receive the contents of an email received by a customer service inbox. The inbox is
monitored by customer service agents providing services for two clients in different industries.
You must determine which of the two industries the email relates to (its 'industry'), and within 
that industry which 'category' best describes its content.

### Industries
The two client industries and options for industry are as follows:

1. Insurance Underwriting (industry: insurance) 
This client provides general insurance underwriting services to
subsidiary insurance firms serving a broad range of insurance products to businesses. This
client receives emails from both contacts at the businesses that are insured and insurance agents
at the subsidiary firms. Emails request many different services, including questions about
existing policies, new policies, company policies, document requests, and technical issues with
associated software, among others.

2. Consumer Goods (industry: consumer)
This client is a manufacturer that produces consumer goods, that are then sold
in large retail stores. This client receives emails from customers who have already purchased
their products, and have questions related to the purchase. Specifically, this inbox receives 
emails with attached images of receipts/proof of purchase, that agents must then validate as
legitimate and within warranty before responding.

### Categories
The categories under the insurance industry are as follows:

1. Policy Endorsements (category: endorsement)
These emails relate to insurance policy endorsements, which are amendments to an existing
insurance policy that add, remove, or modify coverage. Any straightforward request to alter some
detail of an existing policy should be labelled with this category.

2. Document Requests (category: docrequest)
These emails contain requests to provide some kind of documentation related to an existing
insurance policy, for example proof of insurance, certificate of insurance, policy document, etc.
Emails requesting documentation should be in this category, but if emails also request some other
task in addition to requesting documentation, they should likely fall into that category instead.

3. Billing & Payments (category: billing)
These emails relate to insurance policy billing and payments, broadly.

4. Appetite & Coverage (category: appetite)
These emails relate to the appetite of the insurance underwriter to provide coverage for certain
industries or business types. These emails would generally be from insurance agents of the
subsidiary insurance providers to determine if potential insurees are within the underwriter's
coverage appetite, but could at times also be from business owners seeking insurance.

5. General Underwriting (category: underwriting)
These emails contain more complex service requests related to general insurance underwriting,
that can't be so easily classified into one of the other categories, and need an experienced and
licensed individual to assist with. These emails could also be correctly labelled with one or
more of the other categories, but are more complex. If a request has many steps, touches many
different topics, or covers a topic that does not fall under one of the other categories, use 
your best judgement to label it with this category.

The categories under the consumer industry are as follows:

1. Proof of Purchase Validation (category: receipt)
These emails provide images of receipts providing proof of purchase for a retail transaction. If
the email has an image attached, it is in this category. The content of the email itself, unless
wildly inappropriate for this category, matter less than the presence of an attached image.

### Input Format
You will receive the email contents under the 'Email Content' header, separated by subject, body, and attachment file name. If no attachment file name is provided, the email has no attachment.

### Output Format
Provide an 'industry' and 'category' for the email, as accurately as you can determine. You must
provide both fields for the email, do not leave either blank. If multiple labels seem to fit,
provide the labels you feel are most accurate based on the descriptions previously provided.
An output format will be provided to you, output your response exactly as specified, with labels
perfectly matching the options. Your output needs to be machine parseable, so do not deviate from
this format.
