Subject: Renewal Notice Question
Body: Hello,

I received our renewal notice and the premium increased significantly this year. We're a small family restaurant and this is putting a strain on our budget.

Do you offer any payment plan options? We'd prefer to pay monthly or quarterly if possible.

Also, could you explain why the premium went up so much? We haven't had any claims.

Thank you,

Subject: Policy Cancellation Question
Body: Dear Customer Service,

I'm writing regarding our policy #NS-2025-003 which was cancelled effective July 15, 2025. We paid the annual premium of $8,450.00 in full on January 15, 2025.

Since the policy was cancelled mid-term, I believe we're entitled to a pro-rated refund for the unused portion of the policy period (approximately 6.5 months).

Could you please calculate the refund amount and process it? I'd prefer a check mailed to our business address.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Subject: Client Placement Question
Body: Good morning,

I have a general contractor client that I'm having trouble placing due to their claims history. Here are the details:

• Business: Commercial construction, primarily retail and office buildings

• Claims in last 3 years:
  - 2023: $85K property damage claim

They've implemented new safety protocols and haven't had any claims in the last 18 months. Are you comfortable with this type of risk profile, or is this outside your appetite?

UNDERWRITING

Subject: ISO Code Mapping Issue - Quoting Tool
Body: Hello Support Team,

I'm having trouble with the ISO code mapping in your quoting tool. When I select "Restaurant" as the business class, it's showing multiple ISO codes but I can't determine which one applies to my client's specific situation.

My client operates a food truck that also has a brick-and-mortar location. They do catering, delivery, and have a small dining area. The tool shows codes for:
• Restaurant - No Delivery
• Restaurant - With Delivery
• Mobile Food Service
• Catering Service

Which ISO code should I use for this hybrid operation? Also, is there documentation available that explains the differences between these classifications?

Thanks,

Subject: Policy Form Endorsement Availability
Body: Hi,

I'm working on a construction client and need to know what additional insured endorsements are available for your general liability policy.

Specifically, I need:
1. CG 20 10 - Additional Insured - Owners, Lessees or Contractors
2. CG 20 37 - Additional Insured - Designated Person or Organization
3. CG 20 38 - Additional Insured - Person or Organization

Are all of these available? And what are the limitations or restrictions on each?

Also, do you have any specific endorsements for project-specific additional insured status?

Thanks,

Subject: Loss Run Dispute
Body: Good morning,

I have a client who is disputing some claims that are showing up on their loss runs. They're saying these claims were either settled for different amounts or shouldn't be there at all.

What's the process for verifying or disputing claims information? Do I need to have the client contact you directly, or can I submit documentation on their behalf?

Also, how long does it typically take to get a response on claims verification requests?

Thanks,

Subject: Policy Territory and Coverage Extensions
Body: Hi Support Team,

I have a client that operates in multiple states and needs clarification on territory coverage.

Their business operates in:
- Primary location: California
- Regular operations: Nevada, Arizona
- Occasional work: Oregon, Washington

I see your policy shows "Worldwide coverage" but with some exclusions. Can you clarify:
1. Are there any specific territory restrictions I should be aware of?
2. Do you offer coverage extensions for international operations?
3. Are there any special requirements for operations in certain states?

Also, do you have a territory endorsement that specifically lists covered states?

Thanks,

Body: Hello,

I'm working with a manufacturing client and need to understand your loss control requirements and documentation process.

What specific loss control measures are required for:
- Manufacturing operations with 50+ employees
- Operations involving hazardous materials
- Facilities with material handling equipment

Do you have checklists or forms that need to be completed? And what's the process for submitting loss control documentation?

Also, are there any specific training requirements for employees that need to be documented?

Thanks,
